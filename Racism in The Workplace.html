  <h1> The Story of Indigenous Peoples
  </h1>
  <p> Many indigenous peoples are forced to share similar stories. with 40% of indigenous children living in poverty and indigenous women 
  being twice as likely to be in poverty compared to non-indigenous women. with poverty in indigenous communities being more prevelant in the
  northern part of canada. With extreme temperatures and a lack of infrastructure many indigenous peoples die due to lack of quality
  medical care</p>
