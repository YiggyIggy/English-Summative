  <h1> The Story of Indigenous Peoples
  </h1>
  <hr>
  <p> Many indigenous peoples are forced to share similar stories. according to true north aid 40% of indigenous children are living in poverty and indigenous women 
are twice as likely to be in poverty compared to non-indigenous women. With poverty in indigenous communities being more prevelant in the
  northern part of canada. With extreme temperatures and a lack of infrastructure many indigenous peoples die due to lack of quality
  medical care. According to stat canada 80% of indigenous peoples in Inuit Nunangat are without a regular healh care provider.</p>
  <br>
  <p> Call to arms 19, 21 and 23 all address this issue but none of them are completed or have even been started. According to aptnnews the life expectancy of a 
    indigenous man has dropped to 60 years with women dropping to 66 years. Non-indigenous life expectancy is at 79 years for men and 84 years for women. according to data from Alberta First Nations Information Governance Centre
  indigenous peoples are seven times more likely to die from opiod poisoning compared to non-indigenous peoples</p>
